Onto2Nx is NOT MAINTAINED
=========================
This project is no longer maintained. There are a few better alternatives:

- https://github.com/related-sciences/nxontology (Custom parsing of OWL into NetworkX graphs)
- https://github.com/dhimmel/obonet/ (Custom parsing of OBO into NetworkX graphs)
- https://github.com/althonos/pronto (General parsing of OBO + OWL)

If you want to look at the docs, though, they're still here:

.. automodule:: onto2nx
