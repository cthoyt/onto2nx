onto2nx |build| |coverage|
==========================
Converts OWL ontologies and OBO to NetworkX Graphs.

As of its first version, ``onto2nx`` currently relies on the code of a stripped-down version of
`OntoSpy <https://github.com/lambdamusic/Ontospy>`_. We would like to give a huge thank you to
`Michele Pasin <https://github.com/lambdamusic>`_ for all of his hard work and making it available under the
GPL 3.0 license so we could use it too.
