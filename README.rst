onto2nx |build| |coverage|
==========================
Converts OWL ontologies and OBO to NetworkX Graphs.

As of its first version, onto2nx currently relies on the code of a stripped-down version of OntoSpy. We'd
like to thank `Michele Pasin <https://github.com/lambdamusic>`_ for all of his hard work and making
it available under the GPL 3.0 license so we could use it too.
