onto2nx
=======
Converts OWL ontologies and OBO to NetworkX Graphs

As of its first version, onto2nx currently relies on the code of a stripped-down version of OntoSpy. We'd
like to thank `Michele Pasin <https://github.com/lambdamusic>`_ for all of his hard work and making
it avaliable under GPL 3.0 so we could use it too.
